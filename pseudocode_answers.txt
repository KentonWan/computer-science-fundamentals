1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Programmers use pseudocode to be able to develop algorithms as they are brainstorming before writing any code.  Pseudocode is useful because able to focus on what the code should be doing which can then be later applied to the different languages later as needed.  

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Nothing or an error would pop up as it's not actual code. 

Practice Assignments:
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET number to 1
INPUT number
WHILE the number is less than or equal to 100
	PRINT number
	ADD 1 to number
	INPUT number
ENDWHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT name
INPUT phonebook array
ITERATE through phonebook array
	IF name is equal to phonebook entry
		PRINT name and phone number
	ELSE
		PRINT no results found


let phonebookArray = [{name: "John", phone: 555666777}, {name: "Will", phone: 555666777}, {name: "Ken", phone: 555666777}, {name: "Chris", phone: 555666777}]

function searchPhonebook (name, array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (name === array[i].name) {
      return "Name: " + name + ", Phone Number: " + array[i].phone
    }
  }
  return "No results found"
}
