2. Although I don't know the specifics, but I think that Amazon must have solved the supply chain algorithm with their warehouses which would include location, number and what to stock in each warehouse depending on region, fleet of delivery trucks (including number, routes and which trucks deliver which packages) and overall system from order to being processed to delivered.  What stands out is that Amazon is able to deliver so many products within a day or two of order at minimal cost. 

Another company that made a successful algorithm is ikea. They are able to produce well-designed and for the most part well-crafted products at a reasonable price compared to competitors, which makes them so popular.

The last company I want to cite is Ding Tai Fung, a popular Taiwanese restaurant with restaurants across the globe.  They have mastered the algorithm to make these special dumplings that contain soup with a thin yet durable skin, which is important so that the dumpling does not break when handling and thus spills all the soup.  Not only is it a matter of mastering there recipe, but being able to translate that quality in mass quantities at all their restaurants. 

3.  Different factors that make an algorithm efficient versus inefficient are 1) minimal amount of steps to complete the task to increase speed, 2)memory usage, 3) single responsibility for each step, and 4) the resources required to complete the task.
